1 year ago: the key had to be pushed roughly into the lock, it had caught and snagged before the old mechanism finally let me in. With boxes in hand I looked around the new house, as bare as it was then I could already see the potential of memories that could form in this place, new friends who would visit, different recipes I could try, and even a few glasses that might be smashed along the way. For but a moment, the enormity of moving halfway across the country sank in. A new life... a fresh start... how would I begin?
