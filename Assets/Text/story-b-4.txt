A knock at the door! who could that be? Looking back I should have been a little more suspicious when Mum asked if I had plans that month, but it must have slipped my mind because I never expected to see everyone at the door, suitcases in hand. They had come to spend the whole week with me, exploring the city. I felt so much love in those seven days.
