I had been sitting on the sofa at home for a while, the news of what happened had stunned my mind. It was naturally tough to endure, but the people around me helped me open up once more with their company and support. When I was handed a cup of tea to help calm me down. When we went on a coffee walk in the park to get me out of the house. Or when I was distracted by a few rounds of video games. I am forever grateful for them and how strong our connections have grown.

This will always remain a part of me, but the life I had built for myself here is more than just that single event. And good things were just around the corner ;P
