We had to! A bakery to feed the pets of the city. All the fluffy, feathered and friendly companions showed up to the grand opening of our little endeavour.

I kid you not, they were mesmerised as I waved one of our cookies in the air, teasing them with it. Not ideal that my clumsiness kicked in and I ended up dropping the whole bag... Stampede is an understatement.
