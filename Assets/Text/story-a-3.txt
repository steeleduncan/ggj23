The theatre looked gorgeous for the company celebration. I was so proud of us! The best-performing team out of 50 different locations. Going on stage was a first for me! Being there under the spotlight with the others, recognized for our efforts and our own take on the weekend brunch, I felt we could take on any challenge ðŸ’ª
