I swear it felt straight out of a movie. The new 'Polar Encounter 5' had come out and it was madness in there. Could barely move towards the display, and there it was, the last one standing... up for grabs. It was about to be mine when suddenly, *crash!* love at first bump! Or maybe it was the smile and cute glasses ;P
