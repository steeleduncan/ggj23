The camping trip was definitely one to remember. We were all sitting around the campfire when Alec's marshmallow caught fire, and as he flicked the stick around trying to put it out, the marshmallow flew off the top and melted a hole in the side of the tent! ðŸ˜‚ Let's just say we volunteered Alec to sleep on that side, if he happened to wake up with wet socks then you know why.
