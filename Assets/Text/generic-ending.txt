What a year! I've been amazed by all the things that have happened in such a short time. Knowing the lock's quirks, opening the door was now a familiar, easy interaction, and as I looked around my home, memories came to me; the good, the sad, and everything in between. To this day, I feel so lucky to be surrounded by the people that love me and support what I do <3
Year number two, I can't wait to see what you're all about!
